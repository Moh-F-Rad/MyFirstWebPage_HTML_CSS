			<p>Spend a sunny winter day ice fishing on one these day tours near Edmonton, Alberta.
			  Ice fishing is a unique angling experience and a great way to enjoy the solitude
			  and beauty of an Alberta lake in the winter. You can enjoy a sun-filled northern
			  day out on a lake, enjoying the winter wonderland and reeling in the catch of
			  the day.  Ice fishing offers the opportunity to catch some big fish and you
			  have your choice of lakes including Baptiste, Long Island, North Buck or Calling
			  Lake for pike, walleye, whitefish, burbot or perch. All fishing trips are within
			  two to three hours of Edmonton, making this an easy day trip.</p>  

			<p>The use of an underwater camera adds some modern technology to this traditional
			 method of fishing.  You can actually watch the fish approach and strike the hook
			 before reeling it up.  Watching the behaviour of the fish is almost as much fun
			 as catching them!</p>

			<p>From 2 to 10 plus guests, your guides can make your ice fishing experience 
			unforgettable.  On these tours you will target Walleye (Pickerel), Pike, 
			Perch, Burbot, Whitefish, or Rainbow Trout.  Ice fishing can be great for

			 angler or novice angler your guides can customize this winter adventure.</p>
